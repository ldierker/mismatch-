Event: Polyhack Fall 2016

Description: Our project invites the user to upload up to
    three articles of clothing by taking photos of each
    (on mobile the user is given an option to
    take new photos). Our algorithm then goes through and 
    extracts the primary colors of each article and gives
    feedback on the color combination.

Stretch goals:
1) Support uploading a wardrobe & checking clothes
    combinations from this wardrobe
2) Generating an outfit from the wardrobe that matches 
    well
3) Adding in weather functionality and using this for
    a given location to inform choices with how warmly
    the user should dress
